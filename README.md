# Build an App Using Maven

This repository contains scripts to help you build a Work Log App using Maven.

## Prerequisites

- Install Maven on your local Machine.
- Install Java on your local Machine.
- Install Visual Studio Code if you want since that's what I am using in this demo.

   -> cd aws-autoscaling-sns-terraform

2. ***

3. **Review and modify variables**

    -> terraform init

4. **Plan the Deployment**

    -> terraform plan

5. **Apply the Deployment**

6. **Clean up whenever necessary**

    -> terraform destroy

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues, please check the following:
